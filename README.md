4. Use `FlatList` to render the tasks.

### Styling:
- Center the input field and button at the top of the screen.
- Style task items with borders, padding, and margin to ensure the app looks organized.

### State Management:
- Use React's `useState` hook to manage the list of tasks.

### Bonus Features (Optional):
